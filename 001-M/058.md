# `BalancerPoolTokenPrice.getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()` wrongly assumes that all weighted pools use `totalSupply`

## Summary
`BalancerPoolTokenPrice.getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()` which is used to determine the unit price of the pool token for the Balancer weighted pool  wrongly uses totalSupply all the time to get the total supply of the pool, but this would not be true for newer weighted pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
Balancer pools have different methods to get their total supply of minted LP tokens, which is also specified in the docs here https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply . The docs specifies the fact that totalSupply is only used for older stable and weighted pools, and should not be used without checking it first, since the newer pools have pre-minted BPT and getActualSupply should be used in that case. Most of the time, the assumption would be that only the new composable stable pools uses the getActualSupply, but that is not the case, since even the newer weighted pools have and uses the getActualSupply. To give you few examples of newer weighted pools that uses getActualSupply https://etherscan.io/address/0x9f9d900462492d4c21e9523ca95a7cd86142f298 https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ff3a210e57cfe679d9ad1e9ba6453a716c56a2e https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf7b51ce5755513d4be016b0e28d6edeffa1d52a the last one also being on Aura finance. Because of that, the interaction with newer weighted pools and also the future weighted pools would not be accurate since the wrong total supply is used.
## Impact
Impact is a high one since the calculation of shares and the value of the LP tokens would be incorrect because wrong totalSupply is used.

 unit price of the pool token gotten with `BalancerPoolTokenPrice.getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()` for the newer weighted pools and also the future weighted pools would not be accurate, resulting in some losses as the incorrect value is used to calculate `poolMultiplier` [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/submodules/feeds/BalancerPoolTokenPrice.sol#L412) and `poolMultiplier` is used to get the `poolTokenPrice`.

Pool Token price returned by `BalancerPoolTokenPrice.getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()`  would be incorrect resulting in losses in areas of the system which use the Pool Token price returned by `BalancerPoolTokenPrice.getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the protocol would want to interact with multiple weighted pools, try to check first if the weighted pool you are interacting with is a newer one and uses the getActualSupply or if it is an older one and uses totalSupply, in that way the protocol could interact with multiple pools in the long run.
