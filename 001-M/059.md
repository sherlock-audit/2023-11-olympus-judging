# getWeightedPoolTokenPrice() method in BalancerPoolTokenPrice.sol wrongly assumes that all of the weighted pools uses totalSupply()

## Summary
`getWeightedPoolTokenPrice` method in `BalancerPoolTokenPrice.sol` wrongly assumes that all of the weighted pools uses `totalSupply `to get the total supply of the pool

The same issue exists in  `AuraBalancerSupply.sol`

## Vulnerability Detail
Balancer pools have different methods to get their total supply of minted LP tokens, which is also specified in the docs here
https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply .
The docs specifies the fact that `totalSupply` is only used for older stable and weighted pools, and should not be used without checking it first, since the newer pools have pre-minted BPT and `getActualSupply` should be used in that case.

To give few examples of newer weighted pools that uses `getActualSupply`

https://etherscan.io/address/0x3ff3a210e57cfe679d9ad1e9ba6453a716c56a2e
https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf7b51ce5755513d4be016b0e28d6edeffa1d52a
 Because of that, the interaction with newer weighted pools and also the future weighted pools would not be accurate since the wrong total supply is used 

## Impact
wrong total supply is used to calculate price of pool token (or reserves of the pool) would be inaccurate ,which would hurt the protocol .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Try to check first if the weighted pool you are interacting with is a newer one and uses the `getActualSupply` or if it is an older one and uses` totalSupply`, in that way the protocol could interact with multiple pools in the long run.
