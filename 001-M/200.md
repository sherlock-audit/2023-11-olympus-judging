# usage of totalSupply for newer balancer pools should be replaced with getActualSupply

## Summary
totalSupply is used to obtain the supply for all pools which should be replaced with getActualSupply for newer ones 

## Vulnerability Detail
Balancer pools have different methods to get their total supply of minted LP tokens, which is also specified in the docs here
https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply .
The docs specifies that getActualSupply is used by the most recent versions of Weighted and Stable Pools. It accounts for pre-minted BPT as well as due protocol fees. To give you few examples of newer weighted pools that uses getActualSupply

In the current implementation, `totalSupply` is used instead of `getActualSupply` for the calculation of supply and weighted pool token prices. This can cause incorrect computation for newer pools.

## Impact
Incorrect weighted pool token prices and incorrect supply calculation for newer pools.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If `getActualSupply` function exists on the contract, invoke it to obtain the supply.
