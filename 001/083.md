# `BunniSupply::getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` does not take uncollected fees into account, leading to OHM balance discrepancy

## Summary
`BunniSupply::getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` does **not** take uncollected fees into account, while `BunniSupply::getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` does, which will lead to the balances returned from those two functions not matching up

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` function of the `BunniSupply` contract uses the internal `_getOhmReserves` function in order to query the OHM reserves of each Bunni pool. This function **does not** take uncollected fees into account. On the flip side, the `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` function from the same contract uses the internal `_getReservesWithFees` in order to get the reserves of all tokens within each Bunni pool. This function **does** take uncollected fees into account.

Because of that discrepancy, it is possible that the protocol will behave differently in different parts of the system, since the OHM balance values will differ in some places.

## Impact
The RBS system might behave unexpectedly, due to being supplied with different OHM balance values in different places

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Refactor the `_getOhmReserves` function so that it takes protocol fees into account:

```diff
    function _getOhmReserves(
        BunniKey memory key_,
        BunniLens lens_
    ) internal view returns (uint256) {
        (uint112 reserve0, uint112 reserve1) = lens_.getReserves(key_);
+       (uint256 fee0, uint256 fee1) = lens_.getUncollectedFees(key_);
        if (key_.pool.token0() == ohm) {
-           return reserve0;
+           return reserve0 + fee0;
        } else {
-           return reserve1;
+           return reserve1 + fee1;
        }
    }
```
