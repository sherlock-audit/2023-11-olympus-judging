# `BunniPrice::getBunniTokenPrice` returns the TVL in the given Bunni token instead of the price per share of that token

## Summary
The `BunniPrice::getBunniTokenPrice` function returns the TVL in the given Bunni token instead of the price per share of that token

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getBunniTokenPrice` function of the `BunniPrice` contract is intended to return the unit price of the specified `BunniToken`. However, there is a problem with the logic of that function. Since it does not divide the TVL by the total supply of tokens at the end of the function, it actually returns the TVL itself instead of the unit price. This means that whenever the total supply of that token is `!= 1`, the unit price returned by the function will be completely wrong.

## Impact
The `BunniPrice::getBunniTokenPrice` function will return wrong price values, leading to the malfunctioning of the RBS system

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Divide the `totalValue` by the total supply of the Bunni token before returning it
