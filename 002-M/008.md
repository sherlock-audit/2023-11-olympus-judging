# array out-of-bounds access vulnerability in removeAsset function

## Summary
The OlympusTreasury Contract's `removeAsset` function intends to eliminate all locations belonging to one asset. 
However, an issue arises within the for loop. The code employs a cached variable `len = asset.locations.length;`, but after removing an element from the array, the index of the last element changes. 
The code continues to use `len` as the index for the last element, potentially causing an array out-of-bounds access panic.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the misuse of the cached variable `len` as a reference for the last element index in the for loop without updating it after each removal of an element from the array.

## Impact
This vulnerability can lead to an array out-of-bounds access panic, potentially causing the smart contract to behave unexpectedly or halt, which could disrupt the functionality of the contract and impact its security.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-zach030/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L470-L477
Here is the delete logic:
```solidity
        // Remove locations
        len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
            asset.locations.pop();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
Here is the poc code:
```solidity
function test_removeAsset_MultipleLocations() public {
        address[] memory locations = new address[](3);
        locations[0] = address(1);
        locations[1] = address(2);
        locations[2] = address(3);

        // Add an asset
        vm.prank(godmode);
        TRSRY.addAsset(address(reserve), locations);

        // Remove the asset
        vm.prank(godmode);
        TRSRY.removeAsset(address(reserve));

        // Verify asset data
        TRSRYv1_1.Asset memory asset = TRSRY.getAssetData(address(reserve));
        assertEq(asset.approved, false);
        assertEq(asset.lastBalance, 0);
        assertEq(asset.locations.length, 0);

        // Verify asset list
        address[] memory assets = TRSRY.getAssets();
        assertEq(assets.length, 0);
    }
```
And the test result is:
```shell

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To rectify this vulnerability, the code logic should be adjusted to update the `len` variable after each removal from the array, ensuring that it accurately reflects the current length of `asset.locations`.
