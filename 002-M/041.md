# OlympusTreasury.removeAsset will revert

## Summary
OlympusTreasury.removeAsset will revert as it caches length of array from which elements are removed.
## Vulnerability Detail
Using `OlympusTreasury.removeAsset` function permissioned caller can remove approved asset.
This function will revert, because of this loop.

```solidity
        len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
            asset.locations.pop();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
As you can length of `asset.locations` is cached into `len` variable. And then function loops up to this `len` and set `asset.locations[len - 1]` to the `asset.locations[i]`. After `pop` is executed and array size is decreased, which means that next `asset.locations[len - 1]` call will revert.

As result such function will work only, when `asset.locations` has 1 location only.
## Impact
Not possible to remove asset.

## Recommendation
You don't need that loop [as later you remove whole asset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L489C9-L489C34), which will do that job.
