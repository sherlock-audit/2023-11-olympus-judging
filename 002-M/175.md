# Flawed clearing of asset locations array will cause `removeAsset` to revert

## Summary
Incorrect clearing of asset locations array

## Vulnerability Detail
In `removeAsset` when removing the locations, the `len-1` index is accessed with the initial length even after popping the array. In case the number of locations is more than 1, it will revert due to out of bound access
```solidity
        len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
            asset.locations.pop();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
Assets with more than 2 locations cannot be removed

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the assetData is being cleared in the end, the loop can be fully avoided
