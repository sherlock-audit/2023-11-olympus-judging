# Possible accounting issues when calculating pool prices.

## Summary

`BalancerPoolTokenPrice` and `AuraBalancerSupply.sol` countract both use `totalSupply` all to calculate the total supply of the pool in the `getWeightedPoolTokenPrice` and `_getReserves` functions respectively. This is likely to provide wrong values for newer pools as it doesn't account for pre-minted BPT and protocol fees

## Vulnerability Detail
From the [balancer docs](https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply), there are three potential functions to query when determining the BPT supply depending on pool type.

- `getActualSupply`: which is used by the most recent versions of Weighted and Stable Pools. It accounts for pre-minted BPT as well as due protocol fees.

- `getVirtualSupply`: which is used by Linear Pools and "legacy" Stable Phantom Pools and it accounts just for pre-minted BPT.

- `totalSupply`: which is to be called only by older legacy pools since those doesn't have pre-minted BPT.

## Impact
This leads to wrong weighted pool and reserve prices which affect protocol accounting.

```solidity
        // Get the total supply of the balancer pool
        uint256 balTotalSupply = pool.balancerPool.totalSupply();
```
## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation

Consider using `getActualSupply` instead of `totalSupply` so as to prevent wrong price calculations
