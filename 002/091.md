# getReserves doesn't utilize the most accurate method to determine totalSupply for some Balancer pools

## Summary
AuraBalancerSupply getReserves internal function call the totalSupply method at the target Balancer pool to calculate the total supply, but this is not the most accurate value for all pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some Balancer pools premint/burn tokens and those tokens are not taken into account by the totalSupply method. Rather, the team recommends utilizing getActualSupply when such pools are queried. 
As some of the AuraBalancer pools do implement the getActualSupply method, it should be taken into account.
More specifically: 
[PAL80OHM20](https://app.aura.finance/#/42161/pool/11) and [OHM-DAI](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/pool/56) do implement it.
[OHM-wstETH](https://app.aura.finance/#/1/pool/73) does not.

## Impact
The PAL80OHM20 and OHM-DAI pools return wrong total supplies when queried.

## Code Snippet
At [line 345:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/SPPLY/submodules/AuraBalancerSupply.sol#L345)
```solidity
uint256 balTotalSupply = pool.balancerPool.totalSupply();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the total supply logic to prioritize getActualSupply as follows:
```solidity
// Get the total supply of the balancer pool
uint256 balTotalSupply;
try pool.balancerPool.getActualSupply() returns (uint256 actualSupply) {
    balTotalSupply = actualSupply;
} catch {
    balTotalSupply = pool.balancerPool.totalSupply();
}

uint256[] memory balances = new uint256[](_vaultTokens.length);
// Calculate the proportion of the pool balances owned by the polManager
if (balTotalSupply != 0) {
    // Calculate the amount of OHM in the pool owned by the polManager
    // We have to iterate through the tokens array to find the index of OHM
    uint256 tokenLen = _vaultTokens.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < tokenLen; ) {
        uint256 balance = _vaultBalances[i];
        uint256 polBalance = (balance * balBalance) / balTotalSupply;

        balances[i] = polBalance;

        unchecked {
            ++i;
        }
    }
}

```
