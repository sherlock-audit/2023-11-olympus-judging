# FlashLoan attack probability

## Summary
Dependency on `totalSupply` can introduce a vulnerability to flash loan attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_getReserves` of contract `AuraBalancerSupply` relies on the `totalSupply` of the Balancer pool to determine the proportion of pool balances. In this line
```solidity
// Get the total supply of the balancer pool
        uint256 balTotalSupply = pool.balancerPool.totalSupply(); 
```
The code is checking the `totalSupply` of the balancer pool, but the issue is that the total supply can easily be manipulated by using the FlashLoan.

`_getReserves` function is being used in `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` and `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` function


## Impact
`totalSupply` is susceptible to manipulation via a flash loan, it could compromise the accuracy of calculations
