# balancerPool.totalSupply() might not give correct results for newer weighted pools

## Summary
balancerPool.totalSupply() might not give correct results for newer weighted pools
## Vulnerability Detail
As stated by official balancer docs, it is recommended to use getActualSupply() instead for newer weighted pools, since they have fees paid in BPT.

Reference: https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply
```solidity
 /**
     * @notice Returns the effective BPT supply.
     *
     * @dev This would be the same as `totalSupply` however the Pool owes debt to the Protocol in the form of unminted
     * BPT, which will be minted immediately before the next join or exit. We need to take these into account since,
     * even if they don't yet exist, they will effectively be included in any Pool operation that involves BPT.
     *
     * In the vast majority of cases, this function should be used instead of `totalSupply()`.
     *
     * **IMPORTANT NOTE**: calling this function within a Vault context (i.e. in the middle of a join or an exit) is
     * potentially unsafe, since the returned value is manipulable. It is up to the caller to ensure safety.
     *
     * This is because this function calculates the invariant, which requires the state of the pool to be in sync
     * with the state of the Vault. That condition may not be true in the middle of a join or an exit.
     *
     * To call this function safely, attempt to trigger the reentrancy guard in the Vault by calling a non-reentrant
     * function before calling `getActualSupply`. That will make the transaction revert in an unsafe context.
     * (See `whenNotInVaultContext` in `WeightedPool`).
     *
     * See https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345 for reference.

    function getActualSupply() external view returns (uint256) {
        uint256 supply = totalSupply();

        (uint256 protocolFeesToBeMinted, ) = _getPreJoinExitProtocolFees(
            getInvariant(),
            _getNormalizedWeights(),
            supply
        );

        return supply.add(protocolFeesToBeMinted);
    }
```

## Impact
Core functions depending  on this totalSupply() method might return incorrect results.
