# getWeightedPoolTokenPrice() wrongly assumes that all of the weighted pools uses totalSupply

## Summary
`BalancerPoolTokenPrice.sol ` which is used specifically for weighted balancer pools wrongly uses totalSupply all the time to get the total supply of the pool, but this would not be true for newer weighted pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
copy from: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-10-notional-judging/issues/36

Balancer pools have different methods to get their total supply of minted LP tokens, which is also specified in the docs here
https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply .
The docs specifies the fact that totalSupply is only used for older stable and weighted pools, and should not be used without checking it first, since the newer pools have pre-minted BPT and getActualSupply should be used in that case. Most of the time, the assumption would be that only the new composable stable pools uses the getActualSupply, but that is not the case, since even the newer weighted pools have and uses the getActualSupply. To give you few examples of newer weighted pools that uses getActualSupply

https://etherscan.io/address/0xcf7b51ce5755513d4be016b0e28d6edeffa1d52a
Because of that, the interaction with newer weighted pools and also the future weighted pools would not be accurate since the wrong total supply is used and calculations like `getWeightedPoolTokenPrice()` would be inaccurate

Note: `AuraBalancerSupply.sol` has same problem

## Impact
error `totalSupply`, getWeightedPoolTokenPrice() will be inaccurate

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function getTotalPoolSupply(address pool) internal view override returns (uint256) {
        // As of this writing the documentation linked above appears inaccurate and the
        // pre-minted total supply returned by a pool is not a fixed constant. Therefore,
        // we use a try / catch here instead.
        try IComposablePool(address(pool)).getActualSupply() returns (uint256 totalSupply) {
            return totalSupply;
        } catch {
            return pool.totalSupply();
        }
    }
```
