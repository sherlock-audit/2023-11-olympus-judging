# `AuraBalancerSupply.sol` wrongly assumes that all of the weighted pools uses `totalSupply`

## Summary
`AuraBalancerSupply.sol` which is used specifically for weighted balancer pools wrongly uses `totalSupply` all the time to get the total supply of the pool, but this would not be true for newer weighted pools.
## Vulnerability Detail
Balancer pools have different methods to get their total supply of minted LP tokens, which is also specified in the docs here
https://docs.balancer.fi/concepts/advanced/valuing-bpt/valuing-bpt.html#getting-bpt-supply .
The docs specifies the fact that totalSupply is only used for older stable and weighted pools, and should not be used without checking it first, since the newer pools have pre-minted BPT and getActualSupply should be used in that case. Most of the time, the assumption would be that only the new composable stable pools uses the getActualSupply, but that is not the case, since even the newer weighted pools have and uses the getActualSupply. To give you few examples of newer weighted pools that uses `getActualSupply`

the last one also being on Aura finance. Because of that, the interaction with newer weighted pools and also the future weighted pools would not be accurate since the wrong total supply is used in  
`_getReserves()`

```
## Impact
The calculation of reserves and the value of the LP tokens is very important for the protocol, and any miscalculations could hurt the protocol and the users a lot.
Also according to Czar
```diff
I would like to draw Watsons' attention to the fact that despite any impact on a view function is a low severity finding per Sherlock rules, in this contest some view functions are to be used by the wider system (not necessarily in-scope), so if the system itself (not external codebases) will be impacted, the finding may be considered valid. Such a finding needs to contain an impact description that draws conclusions in the whole system (i.e. there needs to be a loss of funds/core functionality within the system)

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the protocol would want to interact with multiple weighted pools, try to check first if the weighted pool you are interacting with is a newer one and uses the `getActualSupply` or if it is an older one and uses `totalSupply`, in that way the protocol could interact with multiple pools in the long run.
