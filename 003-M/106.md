# removeCategoryGroup() does not completely remove groups

## Summary
removeCategoryGroup() only does shallow removals, not removing group and its dependencies completely.
## Vulnerability Detail
removeCategoryGroup() only removes group from categoryGroups. However, the 'group' still exists in grouptoCategories and categorization arrays, leaving incorrect results when accessing/ viewing these arrays from external calls.
## Impact
Potentially cause mistakes in viewing and accounting.
