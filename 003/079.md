# `OlympusTreasury::removeAsset` will always revert when `locations.length > 1`

## Summary
When there is more than 1 location for a given asset, the `OlympusTreasury::removeAsset` function will revert due to an index out of bounds error

## Vulnerability Detail
In the current implementation of the `OlympusTreasury::removeAsset` function, there is a block of code that clears the `locations` array of the given asset before removing the asset itself. However, there is a problem with that code.

```solidity
        // Remove locations
        len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
            asset.locations.pop();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

As it can be seen within this for cycle, on each iteration we are assigning the last value from the array to the current index `i`, and then pop off the last element from the array. The problem is that the `len` variable is staying static, despite the fact that the array length decreases after each iteration. This means that this code will always revert due to an index out of bounds error, when the `locations` array length is grater than 1.

This will prevent the asset from being removed, unless its locations are removed from it 1 by 1, until only 1 is left.

Since the protocol is planing to move to a complete on-chain governance system, this issue can prove to be catastrophical in an event where an urgent removal of a given asset is required (as there may be a need to execute multiple governance proposals in order to remove a given asset).

<summary>A coded PoC that demonstrates the issue</summary>
<pre>
    function testPoC_removeAsset_withMoreThanOneLocation() public {
        address[] memory locations = new address[](2);
        locations[0] = address(1);
        locations[1] = address(2);<br/>
        vm.prank(godmode);
        TRSRY.addAsset(address(reserve), locations);<br/>
        vm.expectRevert(abi.encodeWithSignature("Panic(uint256)", 0x32)); //the 0x32 panic code corresponds to the IOOB error<br/>
        vm.prank(godmode);
        TRSRY.removeAsset(address(reserve));
    }

## Impact
Assets won't be able to be removed from the treasury unless their location length is `<= 1`, which might lead to a loss of funds to the protocol in an event where an urgent removal of a given asset is required

## Recommendation

Remove the line of code where the last array element is assigned to the current index

```diff
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
-           asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
            asset.locations.pop();
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
