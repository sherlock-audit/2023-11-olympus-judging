# the function removeassest will not work

## Summary
**len** is not updated which leade to the function to revert 
## Vulnerability Detail
in the function **removeAsset** there is loop which  is used   to removes the locations   from the  assets but when doing it  it is using **len** to subtract and update the location but since len is only updated on line 470 before the loop when the loop get executed the line  472 will revert if the loop is executed for  the second times   because it will try to accesses   len -1 which is not in the range so because of that it will revert 
for example lets say  **asset.locations.length;** is 10 (len =10) so the first loop will be executed  and **asset.locations.length;** will be 9 but **len** is not updated so  when it came to the second one   on line 472 `            asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1];
` will revert because  on the second loop **asset.locations.length** is 9 and since we never updated the **len** variable it  is not and it is trying to subtract 10 -1 which is 9 and trying to access  which is not in the range so due to that it will revert

## Impact
we cant remove assests
