# OlympusTreasury.removeAsset can fail

## Summary

removeAsset will fail if `asset.locations.length` > 1

## Vulnerability Detail

function has following piecec of code:

```solidity
len = asset.locations.length;
for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
    asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1]; // <-- out of bound acess
    asset.locations.pop();
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```

After first iteration `assets.locations.length` will decrease by 1 and last element would have index `len-2` and acess to `len-1` will revert (len is initial length).
This code copy pasted from other functions when there is break after first location remove. Like:

```solidity
 if (assets[i] == asset_) {
      assets[i] = assets[len - 1];
      assets.pop();
      break;
  }
```

But here it's not the case.

## Recommendation

```solidity
  len = asset.locations.length;
  for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
      asset.locations[i] = asset.locations[len - 1]; <- delete this line
      asset.locations.pop();
      unchecked {
          ++i;
      }
  }
```
