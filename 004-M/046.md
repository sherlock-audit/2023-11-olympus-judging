# BunniSupply.getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm doesn't include ohm fees

## Summary
BunniSupply.getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm doesn't include ohm fees and returns smaller amount than real reserves, while `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` includes them.
## Vulnerability Detail
`BunniSupply.getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` function should calculate ohm amount that bunni token holds. To do so `_getOhmReserves` function [is called](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/SPPLY/submodules/BunniSupply.sol#L188C22-L188C37). This function fetches ohm amount from the uniswap v3 position and do not include earned ohm fees for that position.

However, `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` function calculates reserves [with fees included](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/SPPLY/submodules/BunniSupply.sol#L231), which creates inconsistency in both cases. 

So it means that `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` function should include ohm fees as well, or `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` function should not include fees.
## Impact
Inconsistency between supply calculation, getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm doesn't include fees

## Recommendation
Make `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm` function include ohm fees, or exclude fees from `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` function.
