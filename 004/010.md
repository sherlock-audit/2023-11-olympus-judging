# Inconsistent location validation in OlympusTreasury's asset functions

## Summary
Within the OlympusTreasury contract, inconsistency arises between the `addAsset` function and the `addAssetLocation` function. 
The `addAsset` function fails to verify whether the input array of locations contains duplicate elements. 
Conversely, the `addAssetLocation` function imposes a restriction, requiring the locations array to be unique. 
This inconsistency in validation standards presents a potential vulnerability.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the discrepancy in validation checks between the two functions. 
While `addAssetLocation` enforces uniqueness for the locations array, `addAsset` overlooks this check, allowing the addition of assets with duplicate locations. 
This inconsistency poses a risk as it contradicts the expected validation behavior, potentially leading to inconsistencies or unexpected behavior within the contract.
Here is the `addAsset` check logic:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-zach030/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L432-L440
```solidity
// Validate balance locations and store
uint256 len = locations_.length;
for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
    // @audit not check location duplicate
    if (locations_[i] == address(0))
        revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(1, abi.encode(locations_[i]));
    asset.locations.push(locations_[i]);
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
Here is the `addAssetLocation` check logic:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-zach030/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L508-L515
```solidity
// Check that location is not already added
uint256 len = asset.locations.length;
for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
    // @audit check duplicate
    if (asset.locations[i] == location_)
        revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(1, abi.encode(location_));
    unchecked {
        ++i;
    }
}
```
## Impact
The absence of duplicate location validation in the `addAsset` function could lead to assets being added with duplicate locations, contrary to the expected unique location constraint. 
This inconsistency might cause data integrity issues or unexpected behavior within the contract, potentially affecting its functionality.
## Code Snippet
Here is the poc code:
```solidity
function test_addAsset_duplicate_locations() public {
        address[] memory locations = new address[](3);
				// duplicate locations array
        locations[0] = address(1);
        locations[1] = address(1);
        locations[2] = address(1);

        // Add an asset
        vm.prank(godmode);
        TRSRY.addAsset(address(reserve), locations);
        TRSRYv1_1.Asset memory asset = TRSRY.getAssetData(address(reserve));
        assertEq(asset.approved, true);
        assertEq(asset.lastBalance, INITIAL_TOKEN_AMOUNT);
        assertEq(asset.locations.length, 3);
    }
```
Here is the test result:

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, align the validation for duplicate locations in the `addAsset` function with the uniqueness constraint implemented in the `addAssetLocation` function.
