# Multiple Inclusion of Same Location in Asset Tracking Leads to Inaccurate Balance Calculations

## Summary
In the `addAsset` function, there's a lack of validation to prevent the addition of duplicate locations in the `address[] locations_` array. This oversight can lead to the same location being counted multiple times when calculating the `lastBalance` of an asset, resulting in inaccurate balance reporting.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Addition of Asset Without Duplicate Location Check:
```solidity
function addAsset(address asset_, address[] calldata locations_) external override permissioned {
    ...
    uint256 len = locations_.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
        if (locations_[i] == address(0)) revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(1, abi.encode(locations_[i]));
        asset.locations.push(locations_[i]);
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
    // Initialize cache with current value
    (asset.lastBalance, asset.updatedAt) = _getCurrentBalance(asset_);
    
}
```
The loop adds locations from the `locations_[]` array to the asset.locations without checking for duplicates.

2. Current Balance Calculation Counting Locations Multiple Times:

```solidity
   function _getCurrentBalance(address asset_) internal view returns (uint256, uint48) {
        // Cast asset to ERC20
        Asset memory asset = assetData[asset_];
        ERC20 token = ERC20(asset_);

        // Get reserve balance from this contract to begin with
        uint256 balance = getReserveBalance(token);

        // Get balances from other locations
        uint256 len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            balance += token.balanceOf(asset.locations[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
        return (balance, uint48(block.timestamp));
    }
```
The balance of each location is added to the total balance without considering if a location has been added multiple times.


## Impact

**Inaccurate Asset Balances:** Repeated locations can lead to the inflation of the reported asset balance

## Recommendation

Duplicate Check Implementation: Implement a check in addAsset to ensure a location isn't already present in the `asset.locations` array. You could use the same function used in SUPPLY submodules :

```solidity
function _inArray(address asset, address location) internal view {
    uint256 len = asset.locations.length;
    for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
        if (location == address(asset.locations[i])) {
            revert TRSRY_LocationAlreadyExists(location);
        }
        unchecked { ++i; }
    }
}
```
