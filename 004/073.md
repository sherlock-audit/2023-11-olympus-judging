# In function `addAsset`, duplicate check for `locations_` is missing

## Summary

In function `addAsset`, duplicate check for `locations_` is missing

## Vulnerability Detail

In function `addAsset` from `OlympusTreasury.sol`, when storing locations, there is no duplicate check.

```solidity
// Validate balance locations and store
        uint256 len = locations_.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            if (locations_[i] == address(0))
                revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(1, abi.encode(locations_[i]));
            asset.locations.push(locations_[i]);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

As the comment in the function `addAssetLocation` said, “Check that location is not already added”. Therefore, this code snippet clearly violates this requirement.

## Impact

Violates the uniqueness of locations

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add duplicate checks as implemented in function `addAssetLocation`.

```solidity
// Check that location is not already added
        uint256 len = asset.locations.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            if (asset.locations[i] == location_)
                revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(1, abi.encode(location_));
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```
