# OlympusTreasury.addAsset allows duplicated locations, resulting in incorrect asset balance


## Summary

`OlympusTreasury.addAsset` lacks the check for duplicated locations, which results in incorrect asset balance. If the locations array should have duplicated addresses, the balance on the location will be added up to give inflated asset balances.

Note that the asset balance from `OlympusTreasury.getAssetBalance` will eventually used by policies (for example Appraiser).

## Vulnerability Detail

`OlympusTreasury.addAsset` is used to add an asset and the corresponding assetData, including the locations for the asset.

Even though the locations for the asset are checked for the zero address, it lacks the check for the duplicated entry.

If the locations should have duplicated entries, the result of `_getCurrentBalance` will be inflated, as it is adding up all the balances of each locations.

The asset balance will be eventually used in `Appraiser.getAssetValue` to evaluate how much of value the treasure is holding. Therefore the asset evaluation will be incorrect.

## Impact

When an locations array with duplicated entries is added, the asset value will be inflated.
