# location may be added repeatedly

## Summary
In the addAsset function of the OlympusTreasury contract, locations are configured, but locations_ are not checked to see if they contain duplicate data. The same location may be added repeatedly and be included in the asset balance repeatedly.

## Vulnerability Detail
`locations` represents the address array held by the vault that owns this asset. If the array contains the same address multiple times, it will result in repeated balance statistics.

There is a check for duplication in the addAssetLocation function, but there is no check in the addAsset function.

        }

        // Initialize cache with current value
        (asset.lastBalance, asset.updatedAt) = _getCurrentBalance(asset_);
    }
```

## Impact
Possible double-counting of asset balances, resulting in a large display of assets held in the vault. It will ultimately affect the exchange price of OHM.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to check whether there is duplicate data in locations.
