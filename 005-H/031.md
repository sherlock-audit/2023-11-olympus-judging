# The calculation of `getStablePoolTokenPrice()` is incorrect

## Summary
There are significant differences in the calculation methods used by Balancer mining pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
The provided code below is designed to identify the minimum price among all underlying tokens in a Balancer liquidity pool. This minimum price is then used for the valuation of the pool. The calculation method employed by the Balancer pool appears to have a flaw. Let's examine a pool on the mainnet, specifically the wstETH/aETHc pool, where the current [`getRate()`](https://etherscan.io/address/0xdfe6e7e18f6cc65fa13c8d8966013d4fda74b6ba#readContract) is 1012515718556641300. The minimum observed price is 2,481.11. Consequently, the computed price for the LP (liquidity provider) token is 2512.1628744680684. However, the actual price of the LP token is 2,407.77, exceeding the expected value by over 4% which can be checked [here](https://app.apy.vision/pools/balancerv2_eth-wstETH-ankrETH-0xdfe6e7e18f6cc65fa13c8d8966013d4fda74b6ba).
```solidity
 for (uint256 i; i < len; i++) {
                address token = tokens[i];
                if (token == address(0)) revert Balancer_PoolTokenInvalid(poolId, i, token);

                /**
                 * PRICE will revert if there is an issue resolving the price, or if it is 0.
                 *
                 * As the value of the pool token is reliant on the price of every underlying token,
                 * the revert from PRICE is not caught.
                 */
                (uint256 price_, ) = _PRICE().getPrice(token, PRICEv2.Variant.CURRENT); // outputDecimals_

                if (minimumPrice == 0) {
                    minimumPrice = price_;
                } else if (price_ < minimumPrice) {
                    minimumPrice = price_;
                }
            }

```

## Impact
The inaccuracies in the calculation of getStablePoolTokenPrice() can have significant repercussions on the reliability of valuation within the system.
