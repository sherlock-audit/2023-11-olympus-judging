# Wrong methodology for stable BPT price calculation

## Summary

The current methodology for determining the price of the BPT token in the Balancer Stable pool is inaccurate and may lead to significant deviations from the actual price.

## Vulnerability Detail

Currently, to determine the price of the BPT token in the Balancer Stable pool, the current rate is multiplied by the lowest price among the prices of all assets in the pool. This approach resembles the methodology used by Curve, but Balancer pools are different, making this methodology incorrect for them. I will examine a real pool example to demonstrate this claim.

Pool name: Balancer auraBAL Stable Pool
Pool symbol: B-auraBAL-STABLE
Pool type: Stable
Pool value: $11,500,792
Link: https://app.balancer.fi/#/ethereum/pool/0x3dd0843a028c86e0b760b1a76929d1c5ef93a2dd000200000000000000000249

Aura Bal : $11.08
Balancer 80 BAL 20 WETH : $11.26

getRate() : 1035081436163976241 
totalSupply() : 956674679920805725551269

The token with the lowest price is AuraBal - $11.08.

11500792 * 10^18 / 956674679920805725551269 = 12.021633102 // I divide the total pool value by the number of BPT tokens.
1035081436163976241  * 1108 * 10^16 / 1e36 = 11.4687023127 // getRate() * minPrice 

The difference between the two obtained values is nearly 5%, indicating that significant deviations can occur using the employed methodology. While this example doesn't utilize the tokens from the README file, it demonstrates that any pool can reach a state where the applied methodology deviates significantly from the actual price. 

This is a similar issue from different contest: https://solodit.xyz/issues/h-1-stable-bpt-valuation-is-incorrect-and-can-be-exploited-to-cause-protocol-insolvency-sherlock-none-blueberry-update-3-git

## Impact

Potentially incorrect prices returned by the Balancer feed, which could impact the operation of the RBS module. For instance, using the wrong price during a swap may lead to financial losses for the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a different methodology for calculating the price of the BPT token for Stable pools.
