# BalancerPoolTokenPrice::getStablePoolTokenPrice()'s approach might be wrong

## Summary
BalancerPoolTokenPrice::getStablePoolTokenPrice() algorithm might be wrong
## Vulnerability Detail
getStablePoolTokenPrice's approach to price calculation is stated as followed:
```solidity
/**
             * The Balancer docs do not currently state this, but a historical version noted
             * that getRate() should be multiplied by the minimum price of the tokens in the
             * pool in order to get a valuation. This is the same approach as used by Curve stable pools.
             */
```
However, official balancer docs states the following:

> Stable Pools
> The pool.getRate() function returns the exchange rate of a BPT to the underlying base asset of the pool accounting for rate providers, if they exist. A few examples:
> 
> The WETH/wstETH pool will return a rate relative to WETH
> 
> bb-a-USD will return a rate relative to USD, calculated as a weighted average of the underlying stablecoins (DAI, USDC, USDT) in the nested linear pools (bb-a-DAI, bb-a-USDC, bb-a-USDT)

None of the examples implies that we should multiply pool.getRate() to minimum price. 
The second example might even hint that this approach is not correct.

Also from IRateProvider comment
```solidity
/**
     * @dev Returns an 18 decimal fixed point number that is the exchange rate of the token to some other underlying
     * token. The meaning of this rate depends on the context.
     */
