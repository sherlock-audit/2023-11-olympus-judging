# `OlympusTreasury` - When a category group is removed, the categories and asset categorizations linked to it are not

## Summary
When a category group is removed, the categories and asset categorizations linked to it remain as they are, potentially leading to unexpected behavior

## Vulnerability Detail
With the current implementation of the `OlympusTreasury::removeCategoryGroup` function, the only action that takes place within it is the removal of the specified group from the `categoryGroups` array. 
The problem here is that some functions rely on the `categoryToGroup` mapping to get the group of a given category and to also verify that the given category actually exists in the first place. One such function is `OlympusTreasury::getAssetsByCategory`.

```solidity
    function getAssetsByCategory(
        Category category_
    ) public view override returns (address[] memory) {
        // Get category group
        CategoryGroup group = categoryToGroup[category_];
        if (fromCategoryGroup(group) == bytes32(0))
            revert TRSRY_InvalidParams(0, abi.encode(category_));
```

As it can be seen within the first lines of it, it gets the group of the specified category from the `categoryToGroup` mapping and then uses that value to verify the category exists through checking that the `group != bytes32(0)`. However, as it can be seen in `removeCategoryGroup`, that mapping is not being cleared at all, meaning that all functions that are using it will function as if the category group was never removed. 

```solidity
    function addCategory(Category category_, CategoryGroup group_) external override permissioned {
        // Check if the category group exists
        if (!_categoryGroupExists(group_)) revert TRSRY_CategoryGroupDoesNotExist(group_);
```

And as it can be seen in the `OlympusTreasury::addCategory` function, a category can not be added to an unexisting category group. This means that there is an invariant being held - **A category can not exist without an existing category group pointing to it**. Since `removeCategoryGroup` does not respect that invariant, any policies that rely on that invariant being held might end up not functioning properly.

Additionally, when `OlympusTreasury::removeAsset` is called on an asset that has been linked to a category group that has been removed though `removeCategoryGroup`, the `categorization` mapping won't be completely cleared from that asset, since it uses the `categoryGroups` array (which does not contain removed groups within it) to clear the mapping.

```solidity
        // Remove categorization
        len = categoryGroups.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            categorization[asset_][categoryGroups[i]] = toCategory(bytes32(0));
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
```

This will also likely lead to unexpected situations if a removed asset and category group are to be re-added at some point in the future.

## Impact
Downstream policies using the `OlympusTreasury` module might behave unexpectedly

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Extend the logic of the `OlympusTreasury::removeCategoryGroup` function, so that it also clears the categories and asset categorizations linked to the category group being removed
