# ERC4626Price.sol makes a wrong assumption about vault decimals

## Summary
The `ERC4626Price.sol` submodule assumes that the decimals of an ERC4626 asset and its underlying asset will always be the same. It reverts if they are different. However, their decimals can in fact be different. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`ERC4626Price:getPriceFromUnderlying()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/9c8df76dc9820b4c6605d2e1e6d87dcfa9e50070/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/submodules/feeds/ERC4626Price.sol#L85-L140) accepts an ERC4626 vault and returns the price of one share. It first converts the share to assets, then it queries the price of the current asset from the `PRICE` module and computes the result.  It compares the vault decimals with the underlying decimals and if they are different, the whole tx reverts. 

```solidity
            uint8 assetDecimals = asset.decimals();
            uint8 underlyingDecimals = ERC20(underlying).decimals();
            // This shouldn't be possible, but we check anyway
            if (assetDecimals != underlyingDecimals) {
                revert ERC4626_AssetDecimalsMismatch(assetDecimals, underlyingDecimals);
            }
```
According to the comment in the above snippet, it's assumed that a discrepancy between the two will not happen. This is not true. Let's look at the OpenZeppelin's implementation of [`ERC4626.decimals()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/6ba452dea4258afe77726293435f10baf2bed265/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC4626.sol#L106-L108)

```solidity
           function decimals() public view virtual override(IERC20Metadata, ERC20) returns (uint8) {
               return _underlyingDecimals + _decimalsOffset();
           }
```

```solidity
           function _decimalsOffset() internal view virtual returns (uint8) {
              return 0;
           }
```

It returns the `_underlyingDecimals` plus a given offset. This offset can be configured to be a value different from 0. Also, `_underlyingDecimals` can differ from the actual tokens decimals in some cases.

```solidity
    constructor(IERC20 asset_) {
        (bool success, uint8 assetDecimals) = _tryGetAssetDecimals(asset_);
        _underlyingDecimals = success ? assetDecimals : 18;
        _asset = asset_;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Attempts to fetch the asset decimals. A return value of false indicates that the attempt failed in some way.
     */
    function _tryGetAssetDecimals(IERC20 asset_) private view returns (bool, uint8) {
        (bool success, bytes memory encodedDecimals) = address(asset_).staticcall(
            abi.encodeCall(IERC20Metadata.decimals, ())
        );
        if (success && encodedDecimals.length >= 32) {
            uint256 returnedDecimals = abi.decode(encodedDecimals, (uint256));
            if (returnedDecimals <= type(uint8).max) {
                return (true, uint8(returnedDecimals));
            }
        }
        return (false, 0);
    }
```

## Impact
The price submodule will not support vaults with different decimals compared to their underlying asset. Even worse, if an already configured vault can change the `offsetDecimals` after deployment, such change will brick the submodule. If this submodule is the only feed used to determine the price of an asset, this asset can stay for a very long time in an undesired price range, the RBS will not be able to do its work and the protocol can lose value. 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            uint8 assetDecimals = asset.decimals();
            uint8 underlyingDecimals = ERC20(underlying).decimals();
            // This shouldn't be possible, but we check anyway
            if (assetDecimals != underlyingDecimals) {
                revert ERC4626_AssetDecimalsMismatch(assetDecimals, underlyingDecimals);
            }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of assuming that the decimals of the vault and its underlying token will never differ, query them both and convert from one to another.
