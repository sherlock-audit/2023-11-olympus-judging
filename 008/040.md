# ERC4626Price.getPriceFromUnderlying will not work with some vaults

## Summary
In case if erc4626 vault decimals value is not equal to underlying token decimals value, then ERC4626Price contract will not work with it.
## Vulnerability Detail
`ERC4626Price.getPriceFromUnderlying` function should return usd price of vault token.

It has [this check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/submodules/feeds/ERC4626Price.sol#L111-L113) and supposes that there are no erc4626 vaults that have other decimals value than it's underlying token decimals.

This assumption is wrong and there is no any requirement that erc4626 vault should have same decimals in the specification. Thus such vault can be created and used(and it can work perfectly fine, just use conversions). Previously i have already audited such vaults, however couldn't find the proof.
## Impact
ERC4626Price contract will not be possible to get price for such vault, thus it's likely that olympus will not be able to use such vaults.
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I don't think that you need that check. Just do correct conversion using decimals of both tokens.
