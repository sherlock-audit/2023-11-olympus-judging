# `_getFeedPrice` function  will return the wrong price for asset if underlying aggregator hits minAnswer

## Summary
Chainlink aggregators have a built in circuit breaker if the price of an asset goes outside of a predetermined price band. The result is that if an asset experiences a huge drop in value (i.e. LUNA crash) the price of the oracle will continue to return the minPrice instead of the actual price of the asset. This would allow user to continue borrowing with the asset but at the wrong price. This is exactly what happened to [Venus on BSC when LUNA imploded](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/).

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
 {
            try feed_.latestRoundData() returns (
                uint80 roundId,
                int256 priceInt,
                uint256 startedAt,
                uint256 updatedAt,
                uint80 answeredInRound
            ) {
                roundData = FeedRoundData(roundId, priceInt, startedAt, updatedAt, answeredInRound);
            } catch (bytes memory) {
                revert Chainlink_FeedInvalid(address(feed_));
            }
        }
        _validatePriceFeedResult(feed_, roundData, block.timestamp, uint256(updateThreshold_));
```

this then calls for `_validatePriceFeedResult` function which is as follow

```solidity
function _validatePriceFeedResult(
        AggregatorV2V3Interface feed_,
        FeedRoundData memory roundData,
        uint256 blockTimestamp,
        uint256 paramsUpdateThreshold
    ) internal pure {
        if (roundData.priceInt <= 0)
            revert Chainlink_FeedPriceInvalid(address(feed_), roundData.priceInt);

        if (roundData.updatedAt < blockTimestamp - paramsUpdateThreshold)
            revert Chainlink_FeedRoundStale(
                address(feed_),
                roundData.updatedAt,
                blockTimestamp - paramsUpdateThreshold
            );

        if (roundData.answeredInRound != roundData.roundId)
            revert Chainlink_FeedRoundMismatch(
                address(feed_),
                roundData.roundId,
                roundData.answeredInRound
            );
    }
```

Now if we see in the readme of the project
![image](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-Nabeel-javaid/assets/95472385/c9cb9871-1022-4ff6-ab58-b3fde5669854)
there are several different kind of ERC20 tokens which the project will use and some of them are Stable coin, if we see the history recently `UST` was depegged and never recovered its value and went beyond its limit so this kind of risks are real, although its rare but the risk is real.

`ChainlinkPriceFeeds#_getFeedPrice pulls` the associated aggregator and requests round data from it. ChainlinkAggregators have `minPrice` and `maxPrice` circuit breakers built into them. This means that if the price of the asset drops below the minPrice, the protocol will continue to value the token at minPrice instead of it's actual value. This will bankrupt the protocol.

Example: TokenA has a minPrice of $1. The price of TokenA drops to $0.10. The aggregator still returns $1 which is 10x it's actual value.

Note: Chainlink oracles are used a just one piece of the OracleAggregator system and it is assumed that using a combination of other oracles, a scenario like this can be avoided. However this is not the case because the other oracles also have their flaws that can still allow this to be exploited. As an example if the chainlink oracle is being used with a UniswapV3Oracle which uses a long TWAP then this will be exploitable when the TWAP is near the minPrice on the way down. In a scenario like that it wouldn't matter what the third oracle was because it would be bypassed with the two matching oracles prices. If secondary oracles like Band are used a malicious user could DDOS relayers to prevent update pricing. Once the price becomes stale the chainlink oracle would be the only oracle left and it's price would be used.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_getFeedPrice should check the returned answer against the minPrice/maxPrice and revert if the answer is outside of the bounds:
