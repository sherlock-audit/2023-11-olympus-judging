# OlympusTreasury.getCategoryBalance supposes that all tokens in the category are same

## Summary
OlympusTreasury.getCategoryBalance function loops through all assets in the category and sums their balance. The problem is that it doesn't do any conversions and just sums different tokens. 
## Vulnerability Detail
`OlympusTreasury` operates with categories. Each category can have some amount of assets linked to it. `categorize` function [allows to link asset](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L666). Asset can be linked only to one category. Asset is just a token and locations are [the places where balance of token should be checked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L518).

So `_getCurrentBalance` function will get [balance of Treasury in the asset's token, its debt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L232) and also [balance of each location](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L326). As result we will have total assets balance denominated in asset's token.

`OlympusTreasury.getCategoryBalance` function [fetches all assets that belong to the category](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L382). And the loops through them to get their balance and [sum them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-rvierdiyev/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L390).

The problem is that each asset has different token, which means that returned balance will be incorrect value, as it will be a mix of different token's balances with different decimals.
## Impact
Returned balance is incorrect value

## Recommendation
You need to convert asset's balances to some common token or to the usd value.
