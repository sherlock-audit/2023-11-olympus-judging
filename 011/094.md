# ```setDebt``` could be front-runned on purpose or by accident

## Summary

The [```setDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-PierricM) function is vulnerable to front-running. 
In particular, a ```permissioned``` user could call [```incurDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L152-L165) with more gas when [```setDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-PierricM) is being called, effectively incurring free debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's have a look at the [```setDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-PierricM) function below 

```solidity
    function setDebt(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 oldDebt = reserveDebt[token_][debtor_];

        reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] = amount_;

        if (oldDebt < amount_) totalDebt[token_] += amount_ - oldDebt;
        else totalDebt[token_] -= oldDebt - amount_;

        emit DebtSet(token_, debtor_, amount_);
    }
```

and the [```incurDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L152-L165) function

```solidity
    function incurDebt(
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned onlyWhileActive {
        debtApproval[msg.sender][token_] -= amount_;

        // Add debt to caller
        reserveDebt[token_][msg.sender] += amount_;
        totalDebt[token_] += amount_;

        token_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount_);

        emit DebtIncurred(token_, msg.sender, amount_);
    }
```

Let ```Alice``` and ```Bob``` be two ```permissioned``` users.

Let's now say ```Alice``` calls [```setDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-PierricM) with ```debtor_``` being set to ```Bob``` and ```amount_``` being set to ```10```.

Let's now assume ```Bob``` calls [```incurDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/TRSRY/OlympusTreasury.sol#L152-L165) with a bigger amount of gas, front-running ```Alice```'s transaction, with an ```amount_``` of ```20```.

```Bob``` just incurred an amount ```20``` of new debt, meaning ```reserveDebt[token_][Bob]``` should have been increased by ```20```. Instead ```Alice```'s transaction gets executed and ```reserveDebt[token_][Bob]``` is set to ```10```.

```Bob``` incurred free debt.

## Impact

This vulnerability can have serious consequences as leading to wrong accountancy of existing debt, and the possibility for some users to incur free debt, we thus mark this vulnerability as ```HIGH```.

This situation does not have to be caused by a malicious user and could be accidental with wrong timing / usage of these two functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review / Visual Studio

## Recommendation

In the [```setDebt```](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus-PierricM) function, we could check first that ```reserveDebt[token_][debtor_]``` is equal to 0 before setting its value to ```amount_```.

We would then need to use this function only to initialize debt amount. Further modifications in debt value should be performed via functions to increase or decrease its value, which are more easily protected against front running, as opposed to setting a new value without comparing it to the previous registered value.
