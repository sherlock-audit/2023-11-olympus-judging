# setDebt can be front-runned

## Summary
setDebt can be front-runned allowing user to have more debt than accounted

## Vulnerability Detail
The setDebt function set's the debt of a debtor.

```solidity
    function setDebt(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 oldDebt = reserveDebt[token_][debtor_];

        reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] = amount_;

        if (oldDebt < amount_) totalDebt[token_] += amount_ - oldDebt;
        else totalDebt[token_] -= oldDebt - amount_;

        emit DebtSet(token_, debtor_, amount_);
    }
```

Incase the debtor has approval for more debt, the debtor can first incurDebt to a higher value following which the setDebt will clear off debt higher than the newDebt amount. Vice versa for users who repayDebt.

## Impact
Incorrect debt accounting. Some users may be able to have unaccounted debt

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keep an increasal and decreasal mechanism for manipulating reserveDebt values
