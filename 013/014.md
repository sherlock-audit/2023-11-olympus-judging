# Protocol owned treasury Ohm does not have expected functionality and events as other supply types in CustomSupply.sol do

## Summary

Protocol owned treasury Ohm does not have expected functionality and events as other supply types in CustomSupply.sol do

## Vulnerability Detail

SPPLY module has a submodule called CustomSupply. This submodule has a constructor that accepts (amongst others) `_protocolOwnedTreasuryOhm` amount.

All other supply types (e.g. `_protocolOwnedBorrowableOhm`) have both getter and setter functions defined in the `CustomSupply` abstract class -as well as the corresponding events dispatched when those supplies are updated.

`_protocolOwnedTreasuryOhm` is an exception here. It does not have a setter function and there is no event for its update.

`_protocolOwnedTreasuryOhm` should be treated (and have some functionality) as other supply types.

## Impact

POTO is not updated and does not dispatch an event like other supply types do.

## Code Snippet

No code available as functionality and events are missing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add corresponding event and setter function for `_protocolOwnedTreasuryOhm` state variable, just like other supply types have in `CustomSupply.sol`

```diff
+ event ProtocolOwnedTreasuryValueUpdated(uint256 value);
```

```diff
+ function setProtocolOwnedTreasuryeOhm(uint256 value_) external onlyParent {
+ 	// logic to update the `_protocolOwnedTreasuryOhm` state variable
+ 
+ 	// emit the event
+ 	emit ProtocolOwnedTreasuryValueUpdated(value_);
+ }
```
