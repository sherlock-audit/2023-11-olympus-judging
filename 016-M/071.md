# An infinite loop may occur during the calculation of the token price.

## Summary
When calculating the price of a specific `token`, it depends on another `token`'s price. 
In some cases, the circular dependency can result in an infinite loop.
## Vulnerability Detail
For example, when calculating the price of a `token` from a `Balancer Weighted Pool`, the `lookupToken_` parameter represents the token for which we want to determine the price. 
To achieve this, we identify a relative `token` in the pool, referred to as the `currentToken`.
```solidity
function getTokenPriceFromWeightedPool(
    address lookupToken_,
    uint8 outputDecimals_,
    bytes calldata params_
) external view returns (uint256) {
    try _PRICE().getPrice(currentToken, PRICEv2.Variant.CURRENT) returns (
        uint256 currentPrice,
        uint48 timestamp
    ) {}
}
```
Here, we calculate the price of the `currentToken` using the current `Olympus Price module`.
If this `submodule` is also used in the calculation of the `currentToken`, it will once again depend on the price of the `lookupToken_`. 
This can lead to a continuous and infinite loop in the process.
## Impact
I couldn't find any restrictions when adding `price feeds` for `assets`. 
In certain scenarios, users may incur losses in gas fees when attempting to retrieve the price of a specific `token`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement logic to prevent circular dependencies between `tokens`.
