# OlympusPrice.v2.sol getPrice() Missing check for asset approval and corresponding event

## Summary

There are 2 `getPrice()` functions that do not check if assets are approved and does not emit events. Add checks and events.

## Vulnerability Detail

At line 71 & 86 in `OlympusPrice.v2.sol`, there is no check for asset approval and the `PRICE_AssetNotApproved();` error is never emitted. There are comments in both `getPrice()` functions, but no implementation.

## Impact

`getPrice()` should always revert if the asset isn't approved for use. A missing check can be used for price manipulation. Or potentially can be combined with other parts of the system for a more complex attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an explicit check and emit an event 
function getPrice(...) public view override returns (...) {
        // Check if asset is approved
        if (!_assetData[asset_].approved) revert PRICE_AssetNotApproved(asset_);
}
