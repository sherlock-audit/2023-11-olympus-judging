# getTokenPriceFromStablePool is not compatible with all stable pools

## Summary
BalancerPoolTokenPrice implements getTokenPriceFromStablePool in order to determine the spot price of a specified token from the Balancer pool specified during the call.
The issue is on the methods it uses to get the variables from the stable pool, as some of the try/catch blocks involve calls that are not implemented at all stable pools.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation calls getLastInvariant, which is only implemented in MetaStablePools, such as rETH/WETH: [MetaStablePool | Address 0x1e19cf2d73a72ef1332c882f20534b6519be0276 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x1e19cf2d73a72ef1332c882f20534b6519be0276). 
Other stable pools, such as Balancer USD Stable Pool: [StablePool | Address 0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42 | Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x06df3b2bbb68adc8b0e302443692037ed9f91b42#readContract) don't implement the method at all, therefore always ending up inside the catch block and reverting:
```solidity
catch (bytes memory) {
                    // Ensure that the pool is a stable pool, but not a composable stable pool.
                    // Determining the token price using a composable stable pool is sufficiently different from other
                    // stable pools, and should be added in a separate adapter/function at a later date.
                    revert Balancer_PoolTypeNotStable(poolId);
                }
```

## Impact
Some stable pools will always revert at this function call, even though they aren't a composable stable pool.

## Code Snippet
At [line 811](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/submodules/feeds/BalancerPoolTokenPrice.sol#L811)
```solidity
try pool.getLastInvariant() returns (uint256, uint256 ampFactor) {
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the documentation to inform users that legacy stable pools are not implemented as there are no straightforward methods in place that do implement last invariant calculation for those pools.
