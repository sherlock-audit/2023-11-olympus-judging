# Inefficiency in Withdrawal Approval Process Due to Lack of Balance Check in Treasury Contract

## Summary

The treasury contract's withdrawal approval process does not verify if sufficient token balances are available before approving withdrawals. This oversight could lead to failed transactions for legitimate/last withdrawers that wants to benefit from their withdrawals allowance due to insufficient token balances in the contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
Process to allow a withdrawer to withdraw some tokens is like that : 

1. A permissioned account call increase withdrawer `withdrawApproval`:
```solidity
    function increaseWithdrawApproval(
        address withdrawer_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 approval = withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_];

        uint256 newAmount = type(uint256).max - approval <= amount_
            ? type(uint256).max
            : approval + amount_;
        withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_] = newAmount;
       // @audit missing checking that contract has sufficient balance => token_.balanceOf(address(this));
        emit IncreaseWithdrawApproval(withdrawer_, token_, newAmount);
    }
```
This function increases the withdrawal approval without checking the current token balance in the contract.

2. Then withdrawer uses it using `withdrawReserves()` :
```solidity
    function withdrawReserves(
        address to_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) public override permissioned onlyWhileActive {
        withdrawApproval[msg.sender][token_] -= amount_;
        token_.safeTransfer(to_, amount_);
        emit Withdrawal(msg.sender, to_, token_, amount_);
    }
```
Withdrawals are processed based on the approved amount, not on the actual token balance in the contract.

## Impact
Legitimate withdrawers might encounter failed transactions if the contract lacks sufficient tokens, despite having approval.
If withdrawers wants to withdraw after a whale used it's allowance they could suffer from lack of balance tokens despite having approvals.

## Recommendation
Before increasing or decreasing withdrawal approvals, implement a check to ensure the contract has sufficient token balance to handle these allowances
