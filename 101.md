# `_validatePriceFeedResult` uses the same heartbeat for both feeds which is highly dangerous

## Summary
See Vulnerability Detail

## Vulnerability Detail
` _validatePriceFeedResult` uses the same heartbeat for all feeds when checking if the data feed is fresh. User can pass the `updateThreshold_` (which is acting as a hearbeat) into the function `_getFeedPrice` in the form of params into other functions like `getOneFeedPrice` `getTwoFeedPriceDiv` `getTwoFeedPriceMul` The issue with this is that the [DAI/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/stablecoins/dai-usd) oracle has a 1 hour heartbeat but [FXS/USD](https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/fxs-usd) have the hearbeat of 24h. Since they use the same heartbeat the heartbeat needs to be slower of the two or else the contract would be nonfunctional most of the time. The issue is that it would allow the consumption of potentially very stale data from the feed

## Impact
Either near constant downtime or insufficient staleness checks

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use separate heartbeat for different coins.
