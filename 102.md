# Debt Approval methods lack handling overflow and underflow mechanism

## Summary
Debt Approval methods lack handling overflow and underflow mechanism.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the amount of debt approval reaches uint256.max , any additional increaseDebtorApproval() call from the system will cause revert (Same for decreaseDebtorApproval() when debt approval reaches 0) . This is unconventional, for amount approval methods normally do not cause overflow/underflow reverts. These debt approval functions should be able to handle overflow/underflow cases like withdraw approval methods do.
## Impact
DOS when amount of debt approval reaches maximum or 0.

Notice that withdraw methods can handle overflow/underflow:
```solidity
function increaseWithdrawApproval(
        address withdrawer_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 approval = withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_];

     >>>   uint256 newAmount = type(uint256).max - approval <= amount_
            ? type(uint256).max
            : approval + amount_;
        withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_] = newAmount;

        emit IncreaseWithdrawApproval(withdrawer_, token_, newAmount);
    }
```
```solidity
 function decreaseWithdrawApproval(
        address withdrawer_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 approval = withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_];
     >>>   uint256 newAmount = approval <= amount_ ? 0 : approval - amount_;
        withdrawApproval[withdrawer_][token_] = newAmount;

        emit DecreaseWithdrawApproval(withdrawer_, token_, newAmount);
    }
```
