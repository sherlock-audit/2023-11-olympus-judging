# Dusted Ohm token in balancer supply might be ignored

## Summary
Dusted Ohm token in balancer supply might be ignored
## Vulnerability Detail
To get the amount of reserve tokens in the balancer pool owned by the protocol, first we need to calculate the amount of bpt token owned, and then convert it into an equivalent amount of each token.

The problem arises when we are trying to convert bpt token into dusted ohm in the pool. Resulted ohm balance might be zero if the total amount of ohm in the pool is small enough. This scenario is likely to happen because ohm has much less decimals than the other tokens.
```solidity
 uint256 balTotalSupply = pool.balancerPool.totalSupply();
        uint256[] memory balances = new uint256[](_vaultTokens.length);
        // Calculate the proportion of the pool balances owned by the polManager
        if (balTotalSupply != 0) {
            // Calculate the amount of OHM in the pool owned by the polManager
            // We have to iterate through the tokens array to find the index of OHM
            uint256 tokenLen = _vaultTokens.length;
            for (uint256 i; i < tokenLen; ) {
                uint256 balance = _vaultBalances[i];
                
      >>>      uint256 polBalance = (balance * balBalance) / balTotalSupply; //@audit - will return 0 when balance * balBalance < balTotalSupply

                balances[i] = polBalance;

                unchecked {
                    ++i;
                }
            }
        }
```
From the above code, we can easily see that if (balance * balBalance) < balTotalSupply, resulted polBalance will be 0. 
## Impact
Dusted Ohm might be treated unfair to other tokens, since it has only 9 decimals while the others have 18

## Recommendation
Consider handling ohm separately from the rest.
