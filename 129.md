# No re-entrancy checking in `BunniSupply` and `AuraBalancerSupply`.

## Summary
In `BunniSupply`, it calculates Protocol Owned Liquidity by querying reserves from UniswapV3 pool, but it's not checking if current state is re-entered.
In `AuraBalancerSupply`, it calculates Protocol Owned Liquidity by querying reserves from Balancer and Aura pools, but it's not checking if current state is re-entered.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `BunniSupply`, it calculates the OHM amount of Protocol Owned Liquidity by querying `BunniLens` and which calculates reserves using associated Uniswap V3 pool.
Same for `AuraBalancerSupply`, it queries reserves from Balancer and Aura pools.

However, it doesn't check if current state is re-entered, e.g. in callback of UniswapV3's swap function.
This vulnerability leads to OHM supply manipulation which can be abused by an attacker.
For example, an attacker can increase `floatingSupply` and decrease `polSupply` by calculating these amounts in callback of Uniswap's swap function.

FYI, checking deviation in `BunniSupply` does not detect this vulnerability because `slot0` is updated before callback is called.

## Impact
Reentrancy vulnerability leads to token supply manipulation, which can be abused by an attacker.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `BunniSupply`, it has to check `slot0.unlocked` for re-entrancy.
In `AuraBalancerSupply`, it has to check re-entrancy using `VaultReentrancyLib.ensureNotInVaultContext(balVault);`.
