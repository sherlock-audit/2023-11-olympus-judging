# OlympusSupply contract lacks of ohm and gohm validation in constructor

## Summary
OlympusSupply contract lacks of ohm and gohm addresses validation in its constructor.
## Vulnerability Detail
Ohm and Gohm addresses are one of the most important parts of OlympusSupply; the contract won't function if these addresses are not correct. Thus, we need to validate if these two addresses work in the constructor.
## Impact
Olympus Supply depends heavily on ohm and gohm for accounting;  if these two don't function then Olympus Supply wont operate as well.

## Recommendation
Consider doing some view calls to ohm and gohm in constructor to make sure if they work correctly.
