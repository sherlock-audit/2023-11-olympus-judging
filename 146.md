# Mislabeled Parameter in BunniSupply.sol and Missing Check in OlympusSupply.sol Open Doors to Errors and Exploitation

## Summary

1. Incorrect Notice in BunniSupply.sol: The notice misrepresents the actualDeviationBps_ parameter, potentially causing misunderstandings and errors.

2. Missing Check in OlympusSupply.sol: The contract omits a crucial check for a reserves selector when submodules are enabled, risking incomplete data retrieval and potential vulnerabilities.

## Vulnerability Detail

1.The notice in the states that actualDeviationBps_ represents "The maximum deviation from the TWAP in basis points." However, based on the variable name and context, it likely represents the actual deviation, not the maximum allowed deviation.

 [BunniSupply.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/SPPLY/submodules/BunniSupply.sol#L55C1-L56C1)


```solidity
   -  /// @param actualDeviationBps_  The maximum deviation from the TWAP in basis points
   + /// @param actualDeviationBps_  The actual deviation from the TWAP in basis points
```

Developers or users reading the notice might misunderstand the purpose of the actualDeviationBps_ parameter, leading to incorrect assumptions about its usage. This could result in errors in code that relies on this information or difficulty in understanding the contract's behavior.

2.The OlympusSupply.sol omits to check If submodules are enabled and the reserves selector is empty, revert as shown below:

 [OlympusSupply.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/modules/SPPLY/OlympusSupply.sol#L141C9-L142C62)

```solidity
        // If submodules are enabled and the metric selector is empty, revert
        if (useSubmodules_ && submoduleMetricSelector_ == bytes4(0)) revert SPPLY_InvalidParams();
    + if (useSubmodules_ && submoduleReservesSelector_ == bytes4(0)) revert SPPLY_InvalidParams();
```
Without this check, a category could be added using submodules but without a defined reserves selector. This could lead to incomplete or inconsistent data being retrieved from the submodules, as the code might not know how to access the necessary reserves information.

Malicious actors could potentially exploit this missing check to introduce vulnerabilities or manipulate data. They might craft a category that leverages submodules but intentionally omits the reserves selector to bypass intended validation, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or unauthorized access.

## Impact

1. The incorrect notice could lead to misunderstandings about the actualDeviationBps_ parameter, potentially causing errors in code or confusion about contract behavior.
2. The missing check risks incomplete or inconsistent data retrieval, as submodules might be used without a defined reserves selector. This could also be exploited by malicious actors to bypass validation and potentially introduce vulnerabilities or manipulate data.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. The notice of “The maximum deviation from the TWAP in basis points could be changed into “The actual deviation from the TWAP in basis points” in the BunniSupply.sol contract; 
2. The check of “if (useSubmodules_ && submoduleReservesSelector_ == bytes4(0)) revert SPPLY_InvalidParams();” could be added in the OlympusSupply.sol contract;
