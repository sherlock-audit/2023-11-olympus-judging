# Due to the timestamp(asset and base) of cached price out of sync,the calculated price (the asset in units of `base_`) may be inaccurate

## Summary
`getPriceIn` method is used to calculate the price of the asset in units of `base_` , the problem is due to the block.timestamp(asset and base) of cached prices out of sync,the calculated price (the asset in units of `base_`) may be inaccurate
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/9c8df76dc9820b4c6605d2e1e6d87dcfa9e50070/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/OlympusPrice.v2.sol#L279

## Vulnerability Detail
 as you can see ,in other `getPriceIn` method ,block.timestamp(asset and base) of  prices always keep in sync.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/9c8df76dc9820b4c6605d2e1e6d87dcfa9e50070/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/OlympusPrice.v2.sol#L242

1.Normally,try to use the last prices
assetTime == uint48(block.timestamp) and baseTime == uint48(block.timestamp)
so, assetTime==baseTime, calculate the price of the asset in the base and return

If stale,
assetTime != uint48(block.timestamp) and baseTime != uint48(block.timestamp)
 call the `_getCurrentPrice` method and get current price, 
so ,assetTime==baseTime,then calculate the price of the asset in the base and return

2.timestamp out of sync:
assume current block.timestamp ==a, and 'assetTime' == a,
but 'baseTime' !=a, try to call the` _getCurrentPrice(base_) ` method  and use current 'baseprice',
so 'assetTime' =='baseTime' ==block.timestamp.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
But in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/9c8df76dc9820b4c6605d2e1e6d87dcfa9e50070/bophades/src/modules/PRICE/OlympusPrice.v2.sol#L279
```solidity
 function getPriceIn(
        address asset_,
        address base_,
        Variant variant_
    ) external view override returns (uint256, uint48) 
```

Assume:
Try to use the last prices(variant_=Variant.LAST)
At this point,  cached `assetTime` == a, but  cached `baseTime`==b . then use different `timestamp` prices to calculate the `price of the asset in units of  base_ `may lead to inaccurate.



## Impact
Use different `block.timestamp` prices to calculate the price of the asset in units of `base_` may lead to price inaccurate,also  impacted on the core function of `OlympusPricev2.sol`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Keeping  timestamp(asset and base) of prices in a consistent state before calculate the price of the asset in units of `base_` .
