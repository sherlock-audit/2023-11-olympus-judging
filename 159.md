# updateMarket functions incorrectly, as it does not set marketCapacity

## Summary

`updateMarket` function works incorrectly, which leads to several different types of failures 

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is what `updateMarket` looks like in its current form:

```solidity
    function updateMarket(
        bool high_,
        uint256 market_,
        uint256 marketCapacity_
    ) public override permissioned {
        // If market id is max uint256, then marketCapacity must be 0
        if (market_ == type(uint256).max && marketCapacity_ != 0) revert RANGE_InvalidParams();

        // Store updated state
        if (high_) {
            _range.high.market = market_;
        } else {
            _range.low.market = market_;
        }

        // @audit: looks like type(uint256).max will just take down the market
        if (market_ == type(uint256).max) {
            emit CushionDown(high_, block.timestamp);
        } else {
            emit CushionUp(high_, block.timestamp, marketCapacity_);
        }
    }
```

Note that it never sets the capacity of the range to `marketCapacity_` anywhere, which has multiple upstream impacts. Furthermore, it never updates `range.low.active` in the event that the `marketCapacity` changes. 

Here is one impact: in `_activate` in `Operator.sol`, `RANGE.updateMarket(high_, market, marketCapacity);` is called. Because `marketCapacity` is not set, the range in this case will just not be updated correctly (and might not even be activated). 

Furthermore, in `operate()` in `Operator.sol`, there are multiple places in which we call `_deactivate` and `_activate` (for example, if the auctioneer market is down and we want to put it back up, or vice versa). These two functions call `updateMarket` but because the range capacity and active status are not set, the range will not be properly updated (which could lead to, for example, someone swapping even though the market should be down). 

## Impact

Messes up large parts of the system -- Ranges are not properly updated, which can lead to cases where people make swaps even though the market should be down.

## Recommendation
Update `updateMarket` to set active status and market capacity
