# EmergencyWithdraw should use `safeTransfer` instead of `transfer`

## Summary
The `emergencyWithdraw` function in the `BondManager` is vulnerable to the "unchecked send" issue. The function utilizes the `transfer` function to send OHM to the treasury (`TRSRY`) without checking the return value, potentially leading to unexpected behavior in case the transfer fails.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from not verifying the success of the `transfer` operation, which may result in the loss of OHM without halting the execution of the function.

## Impact
The impact of this vulnerability could lead to the loss of funds as the contract proceeds with execution even if the transfer fails. This can compromise the expected behavior of the contract and result in unintended consequences.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/9c8df76dc9820b4c6605d2e1e6d87dcfa9e50070/bophades/src/policies/Bonds/BondManager.sol#L326-L328

```solidity
/// @notice Sends OHM from the Bond Manager back to the treasury
/// @param amount_ The amount of OHM to send to the treasury
function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 amount_) external onlyRole("bondmanager_admin") {
    ohm.transfer(address(TRSRY), amount_); // @audit
}
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to implement a check on the return value of the `transfer` function to ensure the successful completion of the OHM transfer. Here is a suggested modification:

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(uint256 amount_) external onlyRole("bondmanager_admin") {
    bool success = ohm.transfer(address(TRSRY), amount_);
    require(success, "Transfer to treasury failed");
}
```

This modification enhances the security of the `emergencyWithdraw` function by reverting the transaction with an error message if the OHM transfer to the treasury is unsuccessful. Adding this check mitigates the "unchecked send" vulnerability.
