# BLVaultSupply, IncurDebtSupply, SiloSupply not compatible with Appraiser and price modules

## Summary

BLVaultSupply, IncurDebtSupply and SiloSupply will return zero address as tokens. Appraiser will not filter out those zero address tokens, resulting in revert from `getPrice` call to the price modules and `decimals()` call. Therefore these supplies will make the calculations of the value of backing revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `Appraiser._backing` calls on `SPPLY.getReservesByCategory()` to get the array of reserves. (for the category "protocol-owned-liquidity")
Then, it loops through the reserves and their tokens on by one and call on the price moduel (`PRICE.getPrice`) to get the token's price and as well as the `decimals` function on the token. (Both will revert if the token address is zero)

Note that the Appraiser does not have the logic to check whether the given tokens addresses are zero.

The function `OlympusSupply.getReservesByCategory`, which is called by the `Appraiser._backing`, will go through each submodule and call the `submoduleReservesSelector`.

The returnData will be decoded as an array of `Reserves` and just added to the `reserves`, which will be returned. Here as well no logic to filter out zero address tokens.

The submoduleReservesSelector for the `protocol-owned-liquidity` is `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves`.

However, some supply implemtations return zero addresses as tokens for the call `getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves()`

`BLVault.getProtocolOwnedLiquidityReserves` will return zero addresses as tokens if it has vaultManagers.

`SiloSupply` and `IncurDebtSupply` will return length 1 reserves array with zero address as the token address.

## Impact

When BLVaultSupply, IncurDebtSupply and SiloSupply submodules are added to the supply module, the `Arraiser._backing` will fail to evaluate the value of the backings.

## Recommendation

consider returning empty array instead.
