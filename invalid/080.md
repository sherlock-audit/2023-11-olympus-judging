# Removed vaults might still be holding funds.


## Summary
A removed `vaultManagers` might still hold a portion of the ohmshare, which is not accounted for in the `removeVaultManager` function.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a `vaultManager` is removed, there's no check for if it holds a portion of the ohmShare. 

## Impact
In the case that the `vaultManager` that's being removed still holds funds, these funds will not be accounted for in the BLVault's total collaterized Ohm until the  it's re-added, if the `vaultManager` is to be removed indefinitely, the remaining funds will be locked in the contract indefinitely.

```solidity
    function removeVaultManager(address vaultManager_) external onlyParent {
        if (vaultManager_ == address(0) || !_inArray(vaultManager_))
            revert BLVaultSupply_InvalidParams();

        uint256 len = vaultManagers.length;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            if (vaultManager_ == address(vaultManagers[i])) {
                vaultManagers[i] = vaultManagers[len - 1];
                vaultManagers.pop();
                emit VaultManagerRemoved(vaultManager_);
                return;
            }
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Code Review

## Recommendation
In the `removeVaultManager` function, check the collaterized Ohm amount first before allowing removal.
