# Chainlink heartbeat time gap is too huge

## Summary
Unrestricted update threshold allows stale oracle pricing data.

## Vulnerability Detail
The ChainlinkPriceFeeds contract does not limit the update threshold for the pricing oracle data. This threshold is configured on deployment via the out-of-scope PRICEv2Install script, which currently sets it to 24 hours

Note: This is similar with one of the rewarded past issue: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-11-isomorph-judging/issues/256

## Impact
There is a risk of stale pricing and front running issue

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the in-scope contract ChainlinkPriceFeeds to restrict the update threshold to a maximum of 3 hours in the getOneFeedPrice and getTwoFeedPriceMul functions.
