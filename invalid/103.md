# repayDebt() will revert when repay amount is greater than reserve debt

## Summary
repayDebt() will revert when repay amount is greater than reserve debt.
## Vulnerability Detail
When the repay amount is greater than the reserve debt, it will cause reserve debt (and potentially total debt) goes underflow. This should not happen since in reality, amount could be slightly greater than current reserve debt because of math rounding differences among system components.  
```solidity
    function repayDebt(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned nonReentrant {
        if (reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] == 0) revert TRSRY_NoDebtOutstanding();

        // Deposit from caller first (to handle nonstandard token transfers)
        uint256 prevBalance = token_.balanceOf(address(this));
        token_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);

        uint256 received = token_.balanceOf(address(this)) - prevBalance;

        // Choose minimum between passed-in amount and received amount
        if (received > amount_) received = amount_;

        // Subtract debt from debtor
        
        >>>reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] -= received; // @audit - causing undeflow revert
        >>>totalDebt[token_] -= received; // @audit - causing undeflow revert

        emit DebtRepaid(token_, debtor_, received);
    }
```
Consider this scenario:
- Current reserve debt is 101
- Repay debt calculation from caller component is 102 (1 unit greater because of rounding)
-  The caller component calls repay debt  with amount = 102, causing the tx reverts.
## Impact
Causing undesirable reverts.

## Recommendation
Consider this change
```solidity
function repayDebt(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned nonReentrant {
        if (reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] == 0) revert TRSRY_NoDebtOutstanding();

        // Deposit from caller first (to handle nonstandard token transfers)
        uint256 prevBalance = token_.balanceOf(address(this));
        token_.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount_);

        uint256 received = token_.balanceOf(address(this)) - prevBalance;

        // Choose minimum between passed-in amount and received amount
        if (received > amount_) received = amount_;

        // Subtract debt from debtor
 
  >>>reserveDebt[token_][debtor_]= reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] <  received ? 0 :  reserveDebt[token_][debtor_] - received;
  >>>totalDebt[token_] = totalDebt[token_] < received ? 0 : totalDebt[token_] - received;

        emit DebtRepaid(token_, debtor_, received);
    }
