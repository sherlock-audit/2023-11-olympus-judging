# Missing check on observationFrequency in the constructor of olympus price contract

## Summary
Missing check on observationFrequency in the constructor of olympus price contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
When observationFrequency is 0, olympus price contract is mostly unusable, since _updateAssetMovingAverage, which many core functions of this contract depends on, will revert whenever being called. However, there is no check in constructor to garuantee that observationFrequency will not be set to 0
## Impact
DOS on olympus price contract

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider add this check
```solidity
    constructor(Kernel kernel_, uint8 decimals_, uint32 observationFrequency_) Module(kernel_) {
        decimals = decimals_;
 >>> if (observationFrequency == 0) revert();
        observationFrequency = observationFrequency_;
    }
```
