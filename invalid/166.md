# Critical Re-entry Vulnerability in UniswapV3OracleHelper's getTimeWeightedTick Function in Oracle.sol

## Summary
The function getTimeWeightedTick in the UniswapV3OracleHelper library lacks proper safeguards against re-entry attacks. The absence of such protections may expose the contract to potential vulnerabilities associated with re-entry attacks.
## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability arises from the fact that the function attempts to fetch data from pool.observe without implementing measures to guard against re-entry attacks. Re-entry attacks occur when a function can be called again before completing its initial execution, potentially leading to unintended and adverse effects on the contract's behavior.
## Impact
This vulnerability could be exploited to execute the getTimeWeightedTick function multiple times concurrently, leading to unexpected behavior and potential security risks. Re-entry attacks might result in the manipulation of state variables or the execution of unintended logic, compromising the integrity and security of the contract.
## Code Snippet
Oracle.sol
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-11-olympus/blob/main/bophades/src/libraries/UniswapV3/Oracle.sol#L67-L92
```solidity
// ... (relevant code snippets)
function getTimeWeightedTick(address pool_, uint32 period_) public view returns (int56) {
    IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(pool_);
    // ... (other code)

    // Get tick and liquidity from the TWAP
    uint32[] memory observationWindow = new uint32[](2);
    observationWindow[0] = period_;
    observationWindow[1] = 0;

    int56 timeWeightedTick;
    try pool.observe(observationWindow) returns (
        int56[] memory tickCumulatives,
        uint160[] memory
    ) {
        timeWeightedTick = (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int32(period_);
    } catch (bytes memory) {
        // This function will revert if the observation window is longer than the oldest observation in the pool
  
        revert UniswapV3OracleHelper_InvalidObservation(pool_, period_);
    }

    // ... (other code)
}
// ... (other code)
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To enhance the security of the getTimeWeightedTick function and mitigate the risk of re-entry attacks, it is recommended to implement the nonReentrant modifier. Below is an example of how you can modify the function to incorporate this safeguard

```solidity
// ... (other imports and declarations)

/// @title      UniswapV3OracleHelper
/// @author     0xJem
/// @notice     Helper functions for Uniswap V3 oracles
library UniswapV3OracleHelper {
    // ... (other constants and errors)

    // Define a state variable to track re-entry status
    bool private locked;

    // ... (other functions)

    /// @notice            Determines the time-weighted tick
    /// @dev               This is calculated as the difference between the tick at the end of the period and the tick at the beginning of the period, divided by the period
    ///
    /// @dev               This function will revert if:
    ///                    - The observation window is too short
    ///                    - The observation window is longer than the oldest observation in the pool
    ///                    - The time-weighted tick is outside the bounds of permissible ticks
    ///
    /// @param pool_       The address of the Uniswap V3 pool
    /// @param period_     The period (in seconds) over which to calculate the time-weighted tick
    /// @return            The time-weighted tick
    function getTimeWeightedTick(address pool_, uint32 period_) public view returns (int56) {
        require(!locked, "Re-entry protection: Function locked");

        IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(pool_);

        // Ensure the observation window is long enough
        if (period_ < TWAP_MIN_OBSERVATION_WINDOW)
            revert UniswapV3OracleHelper_ObservationTooShort(
                pool_,
                period_,
                TWAP_MIN_OBSERVATION_WINDOW
            );

        // Get tick and liquidity from the TWAP
        uint32[] memory observationWindow = new uint32[](2);
        observationWindow[0] = period_;
        observationWindow[1] = 0;

        int56 timeWeightedTick;
        try pool.observe(observationWindow) returns (
            int56[] memory tickCumulatives,
            uint160[] memory
        ) {
            timeWeightedTick = (tickCumulatives[1] - tickCumulatives[0]) / int32(period_);
        } catch (bytes memory) {
            // This function will revert if the observation window is longer than the oldest observation in the pool
            // https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/d8b1c635c275d2a9450bd6a78f3fa2484fef73eb/contracts/libraries/Oracle.sol#L226C30-L226C30
            revert UniswapV3OracleHelper_InvalidObservation(pool_, period_);
        }

        // Ensure the time-weighted tick is within the bounds of permissible ticks
        // Otherwise getQuoteAtTick will revert: https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v3/reference/error-codes
        if (timeWeightedTick > TickMath.MAX_TICK || timeWeightedTick < TickMath.MIN_TICK)
            revert UniswapV3OracleHelper_TickOutOfBounds(
                pool_,
                timeWeightedTick,
                TickMath.MIN_TICK,
                TickMath.MAX_TICK
            );

        // Set the re-entry status to true
        locked = true;

        // Reset the re-entry status after the function completes
        locked = false;

        return timeWeightedTick;
    }

    // ... (other functions)
}
