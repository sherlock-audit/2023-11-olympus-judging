# Balancer vault reentrancy is not checked when interacting with BLVaultManager

## Summary
Lack of reentrancy check when interacting with BLVaultManager allows for manipulation of collateralized ohm value

## Vulnerability Detail
Balancer vaults have a read only reentrancy [vulnerability](https://forum.balancer.fi/t/reentrancy-vulnerability-scope-expanded/4345) which allows to alter the (lp token / reserve balances) ratio. This issue is known by the team and is handled in many places by checking for reentrancy before querying. But the check is not implemented when calling the `getPoolOhmShare` of a BLVaultManager. The `getPoolOhmShare` function queries the balancer vault and pool in order to calculate the value of a share without using any reentrancy checks and is affected by the vulnerability. 

```solidity
    function getCollateralizedOhm() external view override returns (uint256) {
        uint256 len = vaultManagers.length;
        uint256 total;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            // @audit no-reentrancy checks
            total += vaultManagers[i].getPoolOhmShare();
```

```solidity
    function getPoolOhmShare() public view override returns (uint256) {

        IVault vault = IVault(balancerData.vault);
        IBasePool pool = IBasePool(balancerData.liquidityPool);

        uint256 poolTotalSupply = pool.totalSupply();

        (, uint256[] memory balances_, ) = vault.getPoolTokens(pool.getPoolId());

        if (poolTotalSupply == 0) return 0;
        else return (balances_[0] * totalLp) / poolTotalSupply;
    }
```

## Impact
The collateralized ohm supply value can be manipulated by an attacker.
The wider system relies on the supply calculation to be correct in order to perform actions of economical impact

it will be determined to get backing
so it will have an economical impact, as we could be exchanging ohm for treasury assets at a wrong price
