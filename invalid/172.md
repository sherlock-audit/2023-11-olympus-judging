# Incorrect ProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm calculation due to inclusion of other user's reserves

## Summary
ProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm for Bunni can include the liquidity deposited by other users which is not protocol owned

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol owned liquidity in Bunni is calculated as the sum of reserves of all the BunniTokens
```solidity
    function getProtocolOwnedLiquidityOhm() external view override returns (uint256) {

        uint256 len = bunniTokens.length;
        uint256 total;
        for (uint256 i; i < len; ) {
            TokenData storage tokenData = bunniTokens[i];
            BunniLens lens = tokenData.lens;
            BunniKey memory key = _getBunniKey(tokenData.token);

        .........

            total += _getOhmReserves(key, lens);
            unchecked {
                ++i;
            }
        }


        return total;
    }
```

The deposit function of Bunni allows any user to add liquidity to a token. Hence the returned reserve will contain amounts other than the reserves that actually belong to the protocol
```solidity

    // @audit callable by any user
    function deposit(
        DepositParams calldata params
    )
        external
        payable
        virtual
        override
        checkDeadline(params.deadline)
        returns (uint256 shares, uint128 addedLiquidity, uint256 amount0, uint256 amount1)
    {
    }
```  
## Impact
Incorrect assumption of the protocol owned liquidity and hence the supply. An attacker can inflate the liquidity reserves
The wider system relies on the supply calculation to be correct in order to perform actions of economical impact

it will be determined to get backing
so it will have an economical impact, as we could be exchanging ohm for treasury assets at a wrong price

BunniHub allows any user to deposit

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Guard the deposit function in BunniHub or compute the liquidity using shares belonging to the protocol
