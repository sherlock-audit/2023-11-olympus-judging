# Front-Running leading to underflow in Debt Approval Management

## Summary

Front-running admin calls benefits malicious users in the `decreaseDebtorApproval` function of OlympusTreasury.sol. This issue allows a debtor to keep it's debt at an amount higher than intended by front-running an admin's decrease approval transaction and make it revert due to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
    function decreaseDebtorApproval(
        address debtor_,
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned {
        uint256 newAmount = debtApproval[debtor_][token_] - amount_;
        debtApproval[debtor_][token_] = newAmount;
        emit DecreaseDebtorApproval(debtor_, token_, newAmount);
    }

    function incurDebt(
        ERC20 token_,
        uint256 amount_
    ) external override permissioned onlyWhileActive {
        debtApproval[msg.sender][token_] -= amount_;

        // Add debt to caller
        reserveDebt[token_][msg.sender] += amount_;
        totalDebt[token_] += amount_;

        token_.safeTransfer(msg.sender, amount_);

        emit DebtIncurred(token_, msg.sender, amount_);
    }

```

**1. Initial State:** Bob has a debt approval of 1000 USDC (`debtApproval[Bob][USDC] = 1000`).

**2. Admin Action:** Admin initiates a transaction to decrease Bob's debt approval by 500 USDC (`decreaseDebtorApproval(Bob, USDC, 500)`).

**3. Bob's Front-Running Action:**
* Bob sees the admin's transaction in the transaction pool and quickly sends a transaction to incur a debt of 501 USDC (`incurDebt(USDC, 501)`).
* If Bob's transaction gets confirmed first, he utilizes 501 USDC approval and then has only 499 USDC approval left.

**4. Admin's Transaction Confirmation:**
* Admin's transaction is processed afterward but Bob's remaining approval is less than the 500 USDC intended reduction and then revert due to this line : `uint256 newAmount = debtApproval[debtor_][token_] - amount_;` which underflow.

## Impact

Bob can keep his amount of debt approved first even if admin wants to decrease it.

## Recommendation
Implement the same approach as you did for withdrawal approvals : 
```solidity
uint256 newAmount = debtApproval[debtor_][token_] <= amount_ ? 0 : debtApproval[debtor_][token_] - amount_;
```
