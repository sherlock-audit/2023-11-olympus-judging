# Missing `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` circuit breakers in `ChainlinkPriceFeeds`

## Summary
The `ChainlinkPriceFeeds` contract does not implement `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` circuit breakers

## Vulnerability Detail
While the `ChainlinkPriceFeeds` contract does correctly validate the price returned by the Chainlink aggregator for round completeness, freshness and being greater than 0, it fails to validate whether the price has hit `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` circuit breakers defined for the aggregator being queried. This means that if the price of the given asset was to go outside of those bounds, the oracle would start returning the min/max value of the circuit breaker instead of the actual price value. In turn, this will lead to the protocol using wrong price data, potentially leading to the RBS system functioning suboptimally.

The exact vulnerability in question is what caused the [Venus hack on BSC](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) when the LUNA crash happened.

To illustrate the issue further, lets take an example:
- The protocol uses Token X that is currently valued at 1 USD
- The Chainlink price feed used for that token has a `minAnswer` set at 0.10 USD
- At some point in time, the price of X drops down to 0.01 USD
- The Chainlink price feed for X continues to return 0.10 USD, which is x10 more than the actual price of the asset


## Impact
`ChainlinkPriceFeeds` may return wrong price data, leading to the protocol functioning suboptimaly

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement safety checks against the `minAnswer`/`maxAnswer` values, such that when those values are hit you either revert execution or fall back to using an alternative price feed
