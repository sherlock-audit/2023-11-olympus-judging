# OlympusTreasury::addAsset() does not check duplications in locations array

## Summary
OlympusTreasury::addAsset() does not check duplications in locations array
## Vulnerability Detail
addAsset() does not check if there is any duplication in input locations array. As a result, one location might be added multiple times into asset.locations, leading to incorrect accounting. For example, getAssetBalance(), which depends on asset.locations, will return incorrect result. 
## Impact
Potentially disrupt accounting of the system.
